# Hand Gestures Recognition Project

## Overview

This project develops a supervised machine learning model using the HaGRID dataset for gesture recognition (multiclass classification task). 
After exploring and preprocessing the data, we train multiple traditional ML models, and integrates MediaPipe for real-time testing of predictions. 
The goal is to achieve accurate and efficient gesture classification.
